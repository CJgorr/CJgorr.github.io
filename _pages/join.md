Welcome to join our research team if you are interested in engaging in research related to mesoscale meteorology. We can use various methods, including:
* observation analysis (ground-based and upper-air stations, radar, satellite, radiosonde, etc.)
* mesoscale meteorological models (such as WRF)
* ensemble forecasting
* data assimilation
* idealized models (such as CM1 or WRF)
* theoretical modeling (theoretical derivation)  

to explore the dynamical mechanism and forecasting of heavy rainfall and severe convective storms.

## For Postdoctoral fellows and Researchers
We constantly welcome applications for postdoctoral fellows, specially appointed researchers, and associate researchers throughout the year.   

We offer highly competitive salary packages, with an annual salary of 200,000 RMB or more for postdoctoral fellows and associate researchers, and 300,000 RMB or more for specially-appointed researchers. Our research environment is relax and flexible.

## For doctoral and master students 
We recruit 2-3 doctoral and master students every year.    

Including those pursuing direct Ph.D., recommended admission, and those who pass the national entrance examination. Our research group has a strong academic atmosphere, where members assist each other, and we dedicated to providing students with opportunities to take part in domestic and international conferences and exchanges.

## For undergraduate students 
We recruit several groups for research-oriented students who is form the second or third grade every year. We also welcome students who are preparing their undergraduate thesis projects.   

(Warmly welcome students aspiring to publish academic papers during their undergraduate studies.)
