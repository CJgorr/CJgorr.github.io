## Personal Profile
**Yu Du**, professor and doctoral supervisor of the School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. He obtained his Ph.D. in Meteorology from Peking University. He is a recipient of the National Natural Science Foundation of China Excellent Youth and was introduced as a talent through the Sun Yat-sen University "Hundred Talents Program". He is also recognized as an outstanding talent under the "Yixian Scholars Program" and was selected as one of the participants in the 4th Youth Talent Nurturing Project by the China Association for Science and Technology. He has had long-term collaborative visits with the University of Hawaii, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and Pennsylvania State University in the United States. 
Professor Du’s research interests include mesoscale meteorology and dynamics, focusing on the occurrence and development mechanism of severe weather such as heavy rain and strong convection, the diurnal variation of precipitation, and mesoscale numerical simulation and forecasting. He has published nearly 40 papers in esteemed international SCI journals such as Nature Communications, Monthly Weather Review, Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, Journal of Climate, and Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR)，among which nearly 30 papers are the first or corresponding author, including 1 ESI highly cited paper and 1 JGR cover article.

Currently, he serves as an editorial board member for Advances in Atmospheric Sciences and as an associate editor for Monthly Weather Review. He is also a committee member of the Chinese Committee-World Weather Research Programme (CNC-WWRP) and serves as the leader of the "Communication and Education" working group. Additionally, he holds the position of Chief Scientist in the Key Innovation Team of the China Meteorological Administration. He has been involved in leading or participating in the National Key R&D Programs and National Natural Science Foundation of China projects.
He has received the Yibing Xie Award for Youth in Meteorological Science (2015), the Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Science and Technology Outstanding Youth Award (2021), Top Prize of Guangzhou Division of National Higher Education Teaching Innovation Competition for University Teachers. He has also been involved in developing one of the first National First-Class Undergraduate Courses and was awarded the Top Prize of Teaching Competition for Teachers at Sun Yat-sen University, ranking first place in the science category. Furthermore, he has been voted as the "Outstanding Teacher" by students from the School of Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University for five consecutive years from 2019 to 2023.
